Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create.

Science Review © is a web series that tackles controversial topics within the field of science ranging from really complicated ones like "the best method to heat a cup of water" to simpler ones like "Why the Earth is 100% confirmed to conform to a dinosaur-shape". Since the overall theme is understood to be satire and hopefully resonates with viewers as being humourous, the webpage premiering this web series follows along. So the crew bios were intentionally made to be silly and random, as well as the webpage includes funny easter eggs (Try clicking on the word "Science" in the phrase "Science Review ©").

Process: How did you go about implementing the concept.

The theme had to be conveyed as being a science-based series, whilst also portraying it as silly and plain wrong. This was incorporated into the web-design process by adding irrelevant links and silly thumbnails. All the content within the webpage was made to follow along this concept as a general theme.

Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.

I was extremely happy with my webpage a few days before I made the final changes, but I found so many more cool concepts to integrate into it that I eventually went back and did so. I know my craving for adding more features will forever be unsatiated, but I am still quite happy with the version I have online. The javascript interactions helped me further improve the user-experience of my webpage.
