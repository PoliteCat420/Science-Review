          <div class="bioR"> <strong><em>Yasser</em></strong> is a cool guy. He likes memes and plays video games. Apparently, he's a thermonuclear astrophysicist now? I didn't even know that was a thing! He gets very defensive when asked to show certification of his lab safety training. He is currently researching about the electrolytic properties of water, he believes that water conducting electricity is a hoax devised by the same people that claim the Earth is a sphere. He is an active member of the Dinosaur Earth Society, as well as the Resident Science Expert for <span id="Meme1" onclick="meme1()">Science</span> Review ©. Contrary to popular belief, he isn't an actual cat. Though one might argue that he indeed is "polite"!

His homework was stored in a hard disk larger in size than the frog. Needless to say, the frog didn't survive. Youssef found a pair of shiny scissors inside the frog tho. He denies the claim that he stores them under his pillow when he sleeps at night. Youssef often complains about his pillows tearing for some reason. Dr. Yasser accuses Youssef of being biased towards electric heating devices that aren't a microwave oven. Youssef is currently serving his time for murdering a frog by helping Dr. Yasser with his show <span id="Meme2" onclick="meme2()">Science</span> Review ©

          <div class="bioR"> "Who is this guy again?"- Everyone watching Science Review (including Yahia himself). <strong><em>Yahia</em></strong> is a g! He stared into his screen while Youssef and Dr. Yasser filmed the first episode of Science Review. Every once in a while, he'd expel air through his nostrils out of pity to our failed attempts at humour. Due to this patronage of his, he was awarded the position of Chief Creative Officer of <span id="Meme3" onclick="meme3()">Science</span> Review ©.

          <div class="bioL"> <strong><em>Ramon</em></strong> is a full-time dancer (his favourite dance is the Jarabe Tapatío as you can tell from his...eyes). Sometimes when he's feeling good, he might help produce content for <span id="Meme4" onclick="meme4()">Science</span> Review © or something. He majors in physics cuz he's a masochist. We can confirm he's a masochist by the fact that he's enrolled to "aduit" a summer course. Yeesh!

<!-- Just adding more trash humour from my part ;) -->

I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.</p>
